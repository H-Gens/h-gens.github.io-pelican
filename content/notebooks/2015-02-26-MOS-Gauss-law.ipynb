      "There are two applications of [Gauss's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law) used in MOS derivations for computing the [surface potential equation](/mos-surface-potential-equation.html) (SPE).  One of the applications is also used in the formulation of semiconductor charge per unit area from the surface field that is found during the solution of Poisson's equation.  Some background is given before they are discussed.  "

      "The primary assumption is that of an oxide whose oxide-related defects are assumed to only exist at the oxide/semiconductor interface.  These defects are identified with the $Q_o'$ and $Q_{it}'$ variables.  The former is fixed charge that does not change in magnitude with band-bending.  The latter is from interface states, whose occupation does change with band-bending.  \n",

      "The secondary assumption is that the metal, oxide, and semiconductor layers each exist as uniform planes that stretch to infinity in the x and z directions.  The latter assumption permits one to apply Gauss's Law at some arbitrary location and have its result be valid at any location.  \n",
