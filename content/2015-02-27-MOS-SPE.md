Summary: A derivation of the surface potential equation of the idealized MOS capacitor.  The resulting equation is used by the [MOS capacitor derivation]({filename}/2015-02-25-MOSCAP-derivations.md) post in order to relate applied voltages to semiconductor band-bending.  


This post is part of a 4-part series on physics-based modeling of the MOS capacitor.
