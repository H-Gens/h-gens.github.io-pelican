Summary: An IPython notebook showing the derivation of the electrical characteristics of the idealized MOS capacitor by using the one-dimensional solution of Poisson's equation.  The results of the derivation are entirely physics-based and are coded in Python.  The code is used to generate plots showing the derived quantities.
