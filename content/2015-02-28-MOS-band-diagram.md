Summary: The MOS capacitor's band diagram can be drawn using results from the one-dimensional solution of Poisson's equation.  This post uses the results from the [MOS capacitor analysis]({filename}/2015-02-25-MOSCAP-derivations.md) to automate drawing of the band diagram.  Written in an IPython notebook so that the code is shown alongside the discussion.
