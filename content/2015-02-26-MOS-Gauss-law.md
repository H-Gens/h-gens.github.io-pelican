Summary: There are two applications of Gauss's Law used in MOS derivations for computing the surface potential equation (SPE).  One of the applications is also used in the formulation of semiconductor charge per unit area from the surface field that is found during the solution of Poisson's equation.  This post presents both applications of Gauss's law, which are required to complete the [MOS capacitor analysis]({filename}/2015-02-25-MOSCAP-derivations.md).  


This post is part of a 4-part series on physics-based modeling of the MOS capacitor.
